## 📖 Usage Guide

### **Manual Simulation Mode**

Perfect for understanding deadlock concepts and algorithms.

#### Create a Deadlock Scenario

1. **Add Processes**
   - Click "Add Process"
   - Enter name (e.g., P1, P2)

2. **Add Resources**
   - Click "Add Resource"
   - Enter name (e.g., R1, R2)

3. **Create Circular Wait**
   ```
   Allocate: P1 → R1
   Allocate: P2 → R2
   Request:  P1 → R2  (P1 wants R2 but P2 has it)
   Request:  P2 → R1  (P2 wants R1 but P1 has it)
   ```

4. **Observe Results**
   - **Detection Status**: 🚨 Deadlock detected
   - **Prediction Status**: ⚠️ Unsafe state
   - **Recovery Options**: Displayed automatically

#### Example: Dining Philosophers Problem

```
Processes: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 (Philosophers)
Resources: Fork1, Fork2, Fork3, Fork4, Fork5

Allocations:
P1 → Fork1
P2 → Fork2
P3 → Fork3
P4 → Fork4
P5 → Fork5

Requests (Circular Wait):
P1 → Fork2
P2 → Fork3
P3 → Fork4
P4 → Fork5
P5 → Fork1

Result: Deadlock detected! 🚨
```

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) - Deadlock Detection

**Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = processes + resources, E = edges

```python
# Detects cycles in directed graph
def detect_deadlock():
    # Build graph: Process → Resource (request)
    #             Resource → Process (allocation)
    # DFS to find cycles
    # Returns: deadlock cycle or None
```

**Use Case**: Detects existing deadlocks

---

### 2. Banker's Algorithm - Deadlock Prediction

**Complexity**: O(m × n²) where m = resources, n = processes

```python
# Checks if system is in safe state
def check_safe_state():
    # Simulates process execution
    # Finds safe sequence
    # Returns: is_safe, safe_sequence
```

**Use Case**: Prevents deadlocks before they occur

---

### 3. Risk Scoring Algorithm

**Factors Considered**:
- Thread count (30 points)
- Process status (25 points)
- Memory usage (20 points)
- Open files (15 points)
- CPU patterns (10 points)

**Output**: Risk score (0-100) and level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

---

## 🎨 User Interface

### Dashboard

- **Real-time Statistics**
  - Process count
  - Resource count
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage

### Status Blocks

1. **Detection Status** (Green/Red)
   - Shows current deadlock state
   - Displays detected cycles

2. **Prediction Status** (Blue/Yellow)
   - Shows safe/unsafe state
   - Displays safe sequences

### Interactive Graph

- **Process Nodes** (Circles)
  - Color: Blue (#667eea)
  - Represents processes

- **Resource Nodes** (Rectangles)
  - Color: Green (#48bb78)
  - Represents resources

- **Edges**
  - Solid Blue: Allocation (Resource → Process)
  - Dashed Red: Request (Process → Resource)

### Manual Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: No Deadlock**
```
P1 → R1 (Allocate)
Result: ✅ Safe state, Safe sequence: P1
```

**Scenario 2: Simple Deadlock**
```
P1 → R1, P2 → R2 (Allocate)
P1 → R2, P2 → R1 (Request)
Result: 🚨 Deadlock detected!
```

**Scenario 3: Three Process Deadlock**
```
P1 → R1, P2 → R2, P3 → R3 (Allocate)
P1 → R2, P2 → R3, P3 → R1 (Request)
Result: 🚨 Circular wait detected!
```

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 2 processes and 2 resources
2. **Use Prediction**: Check safe state before making allocations
3. **Monitor Risk**: Keep eye on risk scores in real-time mode
4. **Test Recovery**: Try different recovery strategies
5. **Visualize**: Use the graph to understand dependencies

### Common Pitfalls

❌ Creating too many processes at once  
❌ Ignoring prediction warnings  
❌ Terminating critical system processes  
❌ Not checking safe sequences  

✅ Build complexity gradually  
✅ Heed prediction alerts  
✅ Review risk assessments  
✅ Understand safe sequences
